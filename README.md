## 📌 Note
🧪 This project was built primarily for learning and practice purposes, focusing on backend fundamentals with Express.js and server-side rendering with EJS. It uses an in-memory array for data storage, which means all posts will be reset if the server restarts.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements (The Epic Quest Log)

This project is far from finished! Here's a look at the epic quests we plan to add in the future:

-   🧠 **Persistent Data (Database):** Upgrade from the temporary in-memory array to a real database like **MongoDB** to ensure posts are saved permanently.

-   🔐 **User Accounts:** Implement a full authentication system (signup, login, password hashing) so users can securely own and manage their content.

-   🛡️ **Data Validation:** Add server-side checks to ensure all submitted content is clean, valid, and secure before being saved.

-   🤖 **Decoupled API:** Refactor the backend into a dedicated **REST API** to support modern frontends like React or mobile apps.

-   ❤️ **Social Interaction:** Introduce features for **liking** and **commenting** on posts to make the platform more engaging.

-   🖼️ **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload images with their posts to add a visual element to their content.
